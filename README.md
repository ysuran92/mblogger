MoonBound time logger

Ok, this is my first React Native project.
The objective is to build an app that can log the current time of day and date by tapping a button.
Why?
I want to quit smoking, and I'm taking baby steps.
I want to log at what time I last smoke so that I can wait at least one hour before the next cig. Or something like that.
So, yeah. A time logger, or whatever.
Here goes nothing.
